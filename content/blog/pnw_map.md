I created the following interactive map in R using the Leaflet App. It dynamically depicts which census tract neighborhoods in Washington and Oregon are Energy Communities, Tribal Lands, or considered disadvantaged by White House CJEST or DOE DAC metrics.

### Note the purple areas, which indicates neighborhoods that are both energy communities and considered disadvantaged by the federal government.

These areas may be advantageous for clean energy investment.
