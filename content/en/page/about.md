Hey! I'm Miguel, and I'm a PhD student in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University. I'm also the [President](https://vanderbilthustler.com/47776/featured/graduate-student-council-elects-new-executive-board/) of the Graduate Student Body and the co-founder of [Dores Divest](https://divestvanderbilt.com/), a campus sustainable investments campaign. I grew up sailing in Annapolis, Maryland, but am now pleased to call Nashville home.

I have a diverse [work history](/en/Moravec_CV_2022.pdf) in public service, and I'd like to continue to employ myself in the pursuit of a more equitable world. I'm especially interested in issues of climate justice and how we can make the most compelling cases to quickly decarbonize our society. 

This site is an online portfolio of some of my works, please explore and enjoy!
