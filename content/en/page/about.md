Hey! I'm Miguel, and I'm a senior associate with RMI’s US Program. I focus on climate-smart policy solutions to equitably decarbonize the US transportation sector.

Before RMI, I was a student at Vanderbilt University, where I earned my MS in Civil Engineering and was president of the graduate student body.

My proudest work achievement so far has been leading the development of the Smarter MODES Calculator, a tool that quantifies the societal benefits of expanding clean transportation choices. I've shared my analytical findings with congressional staffers, state legislatures, and “America Is All In” coalition partners.

As a researcher, I cut my teeth at US NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory modeling global earth systems. I then focused on transportation resilience, publishing analysis of intermodal systems as part of a US Department of Homeland Security project.

Earlier in my career, I worked for the US EPA’s Safer Chemical Research group, supporting a cross-matrixed team of scientists and policymakers. I also has professional experience with Nissan North America.

Outside of work, I enjoy sailing. As a young man, I completed two years of officer training at the US Naval Academy under an appointment from US Senator Barbara Mikulski.

This site is an online portfolio of some of my works, please explore and enjoy!
