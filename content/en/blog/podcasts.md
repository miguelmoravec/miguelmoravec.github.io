## Active Towns - [E274 Talking Induced Demand and much more](https://www.activetowns.org/2024/12/18/induced-demand-and-more/)

Host John Simmerman and I discuss the opportunities to curb the negative climate impacts of our current car-dependent approach to transportation by providing more sustainable mobility mode choices, such as walking, biking, and transit.

## City Climate Corner - [E53 Transportation Emissions and VMT](https://www.cityclimatecorner.com/episodes/transportation-emissions-and-vmt)

Host Rep. Larry Kraft (Minnesota) and Abby Finis (local Climate Solutions) talk clean transportation with me and Anna Zetkulic, RMI. While electrification is the most obvious emissions reduction strategy, it isn't enough. We talk about how cities and states are tackling the issue, and the huge side benefits that come with VMT reduction.

## Streetsblog Talking Headways - [E495 Reducing Emissions on Highway Projects](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/08/15/talking-headways-podcast-reducing-emissions-on-highway-projects)

"We said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we’ve got Miguel with us. We haven’t let him talk. Just let Miguel talk for a second. Miguel, you know, pulled up his slideshow and said, look, we’ve got this VMT reduction law in Colorado. And Frank said, Chair Hornstein said, okay, this sounds cool...  And so we sat down and we started brainstorming a law in that meeting, framing it a little on the Colorado or maybe a lot on the Colorado law, but also integrating a VMT reduction targets, thinking about how we could influence land use planning as part of this."
