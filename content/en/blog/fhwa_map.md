The following interactive map was created in R using the Leaflet App. It dynamically depicts the location of public comments to the proposed FHWA emissions rule. Each "pin" includes a link to the submitter's comment and information about the comment.

<iframe width="100%" height=450 scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="fhwa_map_toggle_450.html"></iframe>

### Note that comments from individuals are not included due to the lack of public address information.
