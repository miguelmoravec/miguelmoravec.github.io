A recent study has concluded that cities in middle and eastern Tennessee with access to barged petroleum products suffered less during the May shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline.

Vanderbilt University conducted the research in as part of a case study on resilience strategies for navigable portions and associated infrastructure of the Cumberland/Tennessee river couplet system.

Janey Camp and Craig Philip, both research associate professors of civil and environmental engineering and associate director and director of the Vanderbilt Center for Transportational and Operational Resiliency, respectively, are leading the ongoing research. The data collection and analysis on fuel shortages specifically due to the Colonial Pipeline disruption was conducted by a civil engineering doctoral student, Miguel Moravec. The study results were published on Vanderibiltâ€™s research news portion of its website.
