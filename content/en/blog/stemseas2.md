As a Vanderbilt undergraduate, Miguel Moravec took part in a research cruise that used multibeam sonar to map areas of the Queen Charlotte Fault off the Southeast Alaskan coast. He and other students also visited Exit Glacier Park and saw first-hand how fast glacier ice had receded over the past 50 years.

“It was really impactful,” said Moravec, now a Ph.D. student in civil and environmental engineering. “I really wanted to get involved in climate change.”

Moravec also wanted to stay involved with the STEMSEAS, program that gave him the onboard experience. He recently returned from his first expedition as a STEMSEAS mentor, helping introduce a group of community college students from Washington to the wide range of NSF-funded research at sea, including geoscience, oceanography and engineering. The cruise aboard R/V Thomas G. Thompson spanned seven days and 1,000 nautical miles, from Seattle to San Diego.
