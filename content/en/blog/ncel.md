Miguel presented during the [2025 National Caucus of Environmental Legislators (NCEL) Annual Forum](https://www.ncelenviro.org/articles/2025-national-forum/) sharing state-level strategies that expand clean transportation choices and reduce household costs.

During the presentation, Miguel highlighted how states such as Colorado, Virginia, and Minnesota are advancing legislation that increases access to transit, walking, biking, and other clean mobility options—policies that also support local economic development, raise property values, and cut climate pollution.

The session drew an audience of approximately 60 elected officials and featured contributions from fellow panelists:

- **Rep. Michelle Ciccolo (MA-15)**
- **Kyle Whitehead (RTA)**
- **Mike Salisbury (Colorado Energy Office)**

These panelists offered examples of how mode shift, land-use reform, and electrification strategies are being implemented across the country. The discussions underscored a clear trend: state legislatures are increasingly setting the pace for national climate ambition.

Miguel welcomes further dialogue with policymakers and practitioners interested in advancing transportation and climate strategies that can be scaled nationwide.
