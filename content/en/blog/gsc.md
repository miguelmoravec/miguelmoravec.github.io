# 2) About Me

I recently spoke with Zach Joseph from the Vanderbilt Hustler about who I am and what I wanted to do in GSC. Read on below:

## Why am I running for President?

As the current Vice President, I've spent a lot of time working together with the Dept Reps to write and pass resolutions, such as our most recent bill asking the Board to reserve a Trustee position for alumni of VU PhD programs. Along the way, I was struck by how thoughtful and passionate my peers were about improving conditions for other students on campus - and honestly I just want to go to bat for them! As GSC President, I'll leverage my experience calling for change on campus to make sure grad student needs are heard at the higest levels. 

## What do I hope to bring to the Presidency?

One thing I'd like to bring to the Presidency is a sense of transparency about how our agenda is set. That's why I'm already preparing a full, public platform of topics I think GSC should weigh in on at my website (see the bottom of this page). If you have any ideas about things GSC should consider, please [email me](mailto:miguel.moravec@vanderbilt.edu) and I'll get them added to our shortlist!

## Where would I like to continue with previous tracks of the Presidency?

I really admired President Passantino's work creating the graduate student lounge in Alumni Hall, and I'd like to continue fostering a sense of belonging for graduate students on campus. I know they'll be promising opportunities to do just that once the new graduate student housing complex is complete, and I'm interested in what other spaces are available for use in the mean time (pub dining hall, anyone?)

## Where would I like to defer from the path with the Presidency?

I would like to emphasize coalition building more than has historically occured in the GSC. The different campus constitutencies, from faculty to grad students to staff, often have similar goals that would be more likely realized if we worked together. Stay tuned for a more regular relationship between GSC and the Hustler to help broadcast these opportunities to collaborate.

## What is a specific Vanderbilt graduate student-related issue that you think needs to be addressed urgently?

Investing in grad student Mental Health has never been more important than it is now. I believe this point is well characterized in the recent [open letter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWlhairC-UAsnvCUnaYHKuZP5KhdbVnTEf8PmJ2xmeiv_06w/viewform) from the grad students of the Biomedical Sciences Department, who've tragically [lost four of their peers](https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/02/21/suicides-at-vanderbilt-highlight-demand-for-mental-health-services/) in the last two years alone. The GSC has an incredible platform to consider and promote the changes these students are calling for, and under my presidency the council would debate their proposals immediately.

# 3) Priority Agenda Topics 

In addition to concerns brought forward by the department reps, I propose that our GSC address the following important topics:

	- Mental Health üß†
		- Publish list of local providers outside of VU that take student insurance
		- Promote Community events to foster Belonging as often as possible

		- Ask graduate community if vision and dental needs are being met
		- Identify benefits plans in use at peer universities
		- Petition administration to consider improving these benefits	
		
	- Wages üí∞
		- Document the existing wage gap between different PhD programs
		- Model Nashville inflation and rent increases compared to cities with comparable graduate program stipends
		- Leverage GSC platform to meaningfully advocate for wage increases

		- Create formal, inter-departmental cohorts of recruits from underrepresented backgrounds (modeling Duke Sloan program)

	- Disabilities / Accessibility ‚≠ê

		- Win administration support for further subsidizing or eliminating parking fees
		
	- Dept Associations & Grad Org Funding üí∏
		- Promote transparency about funding approval process
		- Engage dept reps whose programs currently do not take advantage of available appropriations
		- Clarify alcohol policy for graduate students (yes, you can use VU money to fund your dept happy hour!)
		
    - Board of Trust Governance ‚Äé‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è
		- Build off momentum of recently passed GSC Board of Trust Bill
