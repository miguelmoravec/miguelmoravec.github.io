The following interactive map was created in R using the Shiny App. It dynamically depicts the increases in the mean, median, and normalized sales price per census tract neighborhood.

## Increase in Median Sales Price in Davidson County, 2013-2016 (%)


This map was created as part of my senior honor's thesis at Vanderbilt University. For the project, I extracted over 60,000 real estate transactions from the Nashville Property Assesor's office API using python scripts to make a comprehensive record of all sales in Davidson County between 2013 and 2016. I then matched that data to US Census and American Community Survey Tract Demographic information to investigate gentrification trends. I was ultimately able to make conclusions about which demographics and communities are most vulnerable.
