The following interactive dashboard was created for our client, the Metropolitan Government of Nashville, as part of a team Data Science Institute effort. The dashboard forecasts debris permit and tonnage generation under a range of scenarios.

## Background

Metro Nashville has set a goal to be solid landfill neutral by 2050. As a rapidly growing city, one of the major sources of solid waste is through development (i.e., construction) and re-development of targeted areas, and renovation of existing housing and infrastructure. The objective of this project is to predict the volume of solid waste based development, teardowns permits, and in the future - based on economic growth - gentrification. This will enable examination of the impact of various operational decisions for informed policy-making. Specifically:

* Predict the tonnage of construction and demolition waste for a fiscal year (July 1 - June 30)
* Predict the tonnage of C&D waste for each material for a fiscal year
* [Forthcoming] Use model to investigate the effect of policies and current recycling capabilities
* [Forthcoming] Create calculator which will assistant contractors in estimating how much recycling may be produced by their project in the context of financial results
