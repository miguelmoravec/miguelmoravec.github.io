During the 2025 Transportation Research Board conference, Miguel collaborated with USDOT staff during several events to represent how federal tools and research were impacting on the ground policy outcomes. These collaborations included:

1. "Progress in Accounting for Induced Vehicle Travel" USDOT Lectern Session Panelist
2. "Crafting a National Climate Change Research Agenda" USDOT Closed Door Meeting

Notably, Miguel was invited by USDOT to serve as a panelist during a lectern session titled "Progress in Accounting for Induced Vehicle Travel."

During this panel, Miguel represented how new USDOT products such as the [Climate Strategies that Work](https://climate-strategies-that-work-usdot.hub.arcgis.com/) Playbook and [Report to Congress on Decarbonization](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2024/ph240/barsoian2/docs/dot-jul24.pdf) were impacting state legislation such as the Maryland Transportation and Climate Alignment Act. 
Miguel captured audience attention with a front page New York Times article on the subject of induced demand and state policy in Colorado.

Miguel was also invited to a closed door meeting of academics and USDOT to discuss the future National Climate Change Research Agenda that would be funded by a USDOT / FAS collaboration. Miguel represented how new studies could be helpful to the decision makers and advocates alike.
