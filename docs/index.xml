      <description>Miguel presented during the 2025 National Caucus of Environmental Legislators (NCEL) Annual Forum sharing state-level strategies that expand clean transportation choices and reduce household costs.
During the presentation, Miguel highlighted how states such as Colorado, Virginia, and Minnesota are advancing legislation that increases access to transit, walking, biking, and other clean mobility options—policies that also support local economic development, raise property values, and cut climate pollution.
The session drew an audience of approximately 60 elected officials and featured contributions from fellow panelists:</description>

      <description>Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m Miguel, and I&amp;rsquo;m a senior associate with RMI’s US Program. I focus on climate-smart policy solutions to equitably decarbonize the US transportation sector.
Before RMI, I was a student at Vanderbilt University, where I earned my MS in Civil Engineering and was president of the graduate student body.
My proudest work achievement so far has been leading the development of the Smarter MODES Calculator, a tool that quantifies the societal benefits of expanding clean transportation choices.</description>

      <title>Miguel briefs the Hill</title>

      <description>In a briefing on Capitol Hill, T4A Policy Associate Corrigan Salerno showed how highway expansion funds in the IIJA dwarfed historic investments in public transit leading to disastrous GHG emissions increases. The short and sweet of it is that mode-shift needs to be coupled with electrification to decrease our GHG emissions. Taylor Reich from the Institute for Transportation &amp;amp; Development Policy explained that coupling electrifying transportation with mode shift (opportunities to travel outside of a car) will save the government and private citizens trillions, lower energy consumption, and lower emissions.</description>

      <title>How to break into Climate Policy</title>

      <description>Hello fellow Earth warrior! If you’re reading this blog, you may be asking yourself what you need to “make it” into a rewarding career of climate policy.
Whether you’re early in your undergraduate career or looking to make a switch from some other industry, today I’m going to walk you through my journey from DC-reject to a full-blown policy professional who’s briefed policymakers from the Hill to New Mexico.
It took me 4 years and as many major setbacks to finally make it to the climate “room where it happens,” but boy was it worth the wait!</description>

      <description>The following interactive map was created in R using the Leaflet App. It dynamically depicts the location of public comments to the proposed FHWA emissions rule. Each &amp;ldquo;pin&amp;rdquo; includes a link to the submitter&amp;rsquo;s comment and information about the comment.

      <description>I created the following interactive map in R using the Leaflet App. It dynamically depicts which census tract neighborhoods in Washington and Oregon are Energy Communities, Tribal Lands, or considered disadvantaged by White House CJEST or DOE DAC metrics.
Note the purple areas, which indicates neighborhoods that are both energy communities and considered disadvantaged by the federal government. These areas may be advantageous for clean energy investment.</description>

      <description>As a Vanderbilt undergraduate, Miguel Moravec took part in a research cruise that used multibeam sonar to map areas of the Queen Charlotte Fault off the Southeast Alaskan coast. He and other students also visited Exit Glacier Park and saw first-hand how fast glacier ice had receded over the past 50 years.
“It was really impactful,” said Moravec, now a Ph.D. student in civil and environmental engineering. “I really wanted to get involved in climate change.</description>

      <description>I completed analysis for a study that concluded that cities in middle and eastern Tennessee with access to barged petroleum products suffered less during the May shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline.
I found a novel relationship between federal waterborne petroleum volumes and crowd sourced Gas buddy station outage data that helped explain how the disruption affected certain southeastern markets.
My research team and I conducted the research in as part of a case study on resilience strategies for navigable portions and associated infrastructure of the Cumberland/Tennessee river couplet system.</description>

      <description>A recent study has concluded that cities in middle and eastern Tennessee with access to barged petroleum products suffered less during the May shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline.
Vanderbilt University conducted the research in as part of a case study on resilience strategies for navigable portions and associated infrastructure of the Cumberland/Tennessee river couplet system.
Janey Camp and Craig Philip, both research associate professors of civil and environmental engineering and associate director and director of the Vanderbilt Center for Transportational and Operational Resiliency, respectively, are leading the ongoing research.</description>

      <description>The following interactive map was created in R using the Shiny App. It dynamically depicts the increases in the mean, median, and normalized sales price per census tract neighborhood.
Increase in Median Sales Price in Davidson County, 2013-2016 (%) This map was created as part of my senior honor&amp;rsquo;s thesis at Vanderbilt University. For the project, I extracted over 60,000 real estate transactions from the Nashville Property Assesor&amp;rsquo;s office API using python scripts to make a comprehensive record of all sales in Davidson County between 2013 and 2016.</description>
