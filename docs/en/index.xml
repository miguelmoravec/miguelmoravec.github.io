      <description>As a Vanderbilt undergraduate, Miguel Moravec took part in a research cruise that used multibeam sonar to map areas of the Queen Charlotte Fault off the Southeast Alaskan coast. He and other students also visited Exit Glacier Park and saw first-hand how fast glacier ice had receded over the past 50 years.
‚ÄúIt was really impactful,‚Äù said Moravec, now a Ph.D. student in civil and environmental engineering. ‚ÄúI really wanted to get involved in climate change.</description>

      <description>In 2016, Miguel worked with NOAA scientists to analyze climate data, automatically generate relevant figures/plots, and ultimately contribute science to the North-American Multi-Model Ensemble, as hosted by Princeton University&amp;rsquo;s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.

      <description>I completed analysis for a study that concluded that cities in middle and eastern Tennessee with access to barged petroleum products suffered less during the May shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline.
I found a novel relationship between federal waterborne petroleum volumes and crowd sourced Gas buddy station outage data that helped explain how the disruption affected certain southeastern markets.
My research team and I conducted the research in as part of a case study on resilience strategies for navigable portions and associated infrastructure of the Cumberland/Tennessee river couplet system.</description>

      <description>The following interactive map was created in R using the Shiny App. It dynamically depicts the increases in the mean, median, and normalized sales price per census tract neighborhood.
Increase in Median Sales Price in Davidson County, 2013-2016 (%) This map was created as part of my senior honor&amp;rsquo;s thesis at Vanderbilt University. For the project, I extracted over 60,000 real estate transactions from the Nashville Property Assesor&amp;rsquo;s office API using python scripts to make a comprehensive record of all sales in Davidson County between 2013 and 2016.</description>

      <description>The following interactive map was created in R using the Leaflet App. It dynamically depicts the location of public comments to the proposed FHWA emissions rule. Each &amp;ldquo;pin&amp;rdquo; includes a link to the submitter&amp;rsquo;s comment and information about the comment.
Note that comments from individuals are not included due to the lack of public address information. This page contains public data and is available by direct link only.</description>

      <description>The following interactive map was created in R using the Leaflet App. It dynamically depicts which census tract neighborhoods in Washington and Oregon are Energy Communities, Tribal Lands, or considered disadvantaged by White House CJEST or DOE DAC metrics.
Note the purple areas, which indicates neighborhoods that are both energy communities and considered disadvantaged by the federal government. This page contains public data and is available by direct link only.</description>
