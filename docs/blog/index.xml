      <description>Hello fellow Earth warrior! If you‚Äôre reading this blog, you may be asking yourself what you need to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù into a rewarding career of climate policy.
Whether you‚Äôre early in your undergraduate career or looking to make a switch from some other industry, today I‚Äôm going to walk you through my journey from DC-reject to a full-blown policy professional who‚Äôs briefed policymakers from the Hill to New Mexico.
It took me 4 years and as many major setbacks to finally make it to the climate ‚Äúroom where it happens,‚Äù but boy was it worth the wait!</description>

      <description>I created the following interactive map in R using the Leaflet App. It dynamically depicts which census tract neighborhoods in Washington and Oregon are Energy Communities, Tribal Lands, or considered disadvantaged by White House CJEST or DOE DAC metrics.
Note the purple areas, which indicates neighborhoods that are both energy communities and considered disadvantaged by the federal government. These areas may be advantageous for clean energy investment.</description>

      <description>As part of a forthcoming Department of Homeland Security Resilience Guide, I created an interactive map of key multimodal infrastructure assets for major economic centers along the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers.

      <description>As a Vanderbilt undergraduate, Miguel Moravec took part in a research cruise that used multibeam sonar to map areas of the Queen Charlotte Fault off the Southeast Alaskan coast. He and other students also visited Exit Glacier Park and saw first-hand how fast glacier ice had receded over the past 50 years.
‚ÄúIt was really impactful,‚Äù said Moravec, now a Ph.D. student in civil and environmental engineering. ‚ÄúI really wanted to get involved in climate change.</description>

      <description>In 2016, Miguel worked with NOAA scientists to analyze climate data, automatically generate relevant figures/plots, and ultimately contribute science to the North-American Multi-Model Ensemble, as hosted by Princeton University&amp;rsquo;s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences.

      <description>I completed analysis for a study that concluded that cities in middle and eastern Tennessee with access to barged petroleum products suffered less during the May shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline.
I found a novel relationship between federal waterborne petroleum volumes and crowd sourced Gas buddy station outage data that helped explain how the disruption affected certain southeastern markets.
My research team and I conducted the research in as part of a case study on resilience strategies for navigable portions and associated infrastructure of the Cumberland/Tennessee river couplet system.</description>

      <description>A recent study has concluded that cities in middle and eastern Tennessee with access to barged petroleum products suffered less during the May shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline.
Vanderbilt University conducted the research in as part of a case study on resilience strategies for navigable portions and associated infrastructure of the Cumberland/Tennessee river couplet system.
Janey Camp and Craig Philip, both research associate professors of civil and environmental engineering and associate director and director of the Vanderbilt Center for Transportational and Operational Resiliency, respectively, are leading the ongoing research.</description>

      <description>The following interactive map was created in R using the Shiny App. It dynamically depicts the increases in the mean, median, and normalized sales price per census tract neighborhood.
Increase in Median Sales Price in Davidson County, 2013-2016 (%) This map was created as part of my senior honor&amp;rsquo;s thesis at Vanderbilt University. For the project, I extracted over 60,000 real estate transactions from the Nashville Property Assesor&amp;rsquo;s office API using python scripts to make a comprehensive record of all sales in Davidson County between 2013 and 2016.</description>
