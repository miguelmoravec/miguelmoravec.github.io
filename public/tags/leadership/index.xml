      <description>Hello fellow Earth warrior! If you‚Äôre reading this blog, you may be asking yourself what you need to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù into a rewarding career of climate policy.
Whether you‚Äôre early in your undergraduate career or looking to make a switch from some other industry, today I‚Äôm going to walk you through my journey from DC-reject to a full-blown policy professional who‚Äôs briefed policymakers from the Hill to New Mexico.
It took me 4 years and as many major setbacks to finally make it to the climate ‚Äúroom where it happens,‚Äù but boy was it worth the wait!</description>

      <description>I created the following interactive map in R using the Leaflet App. It dynamically depicts which census tract neighborhoods in Washington and Oregon are Energy Communities, Tribal Lands, or considered disadvantaged by White House CJEST or DOE DAC metrics.
Note the purple areas, which indicates neighborhoods that are both energy communities and considered disadvantaged by the federal government. These areas may be advantageous for clean energy investment.</description>

      <description>As a Vanderbilt undergraduate, Miguel Moravec took part in a research cruise that used multibeam sonar to map areas of the Queen Charlotte Fault off the Southeast Alaskan coast. He and other students also visited Exit Glacier Park and saw first-hand how fast glacier ice had receded over the past 50 years.
‚ÄúIt was really impactful,‚Äù said Moravec, now a Ph.D. student in civil and environmental engineering. ‚ÄúI really wanted to get involved in climate change.</description>
